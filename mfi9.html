    <p>This website is the perfect way to relax and destress. You type in what's
      making you upset and let it go into the stars. It has a beautiful layout
      and animation, that is breath taking and relaxing to look at.

    <p>Lists some good movies to watch and gives you a netflix option if you
      want to watch it on netflix. You can either select it by mood, genres,
      latest, best, or random. It's nice to have movies picked out for you
      based off what you want to watch instead of researching for 3 hours on
      good movies on google. This website has a nice layout, and a good purpose.
