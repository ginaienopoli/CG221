        <div class="onetext">One Design<br><br>I really love the animation sytle of this website. It's very simplistic
        and has smooth transitions. The animations make it feel professional and at the end you want to see more. Doing this
        is effective in getting the viewer interested and engaged.</div>

        and wanting to explore more. When you hover over the links the image comes forward making you have the urge to see what each 
        piece in his portfolio is about.</div>
