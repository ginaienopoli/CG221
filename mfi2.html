    <h2>My Favorite Internet 2</h2>

    <h3><a href="http://world.time.com/timelapse/">Timelapse</a></h3>
    <p>Timelapse is a cool website where it shows how the world changed through 3 decades using Google satellite. It's interesting 
      how were expanding, such as deforestation, melting glaciers, and man made islands. This site shows how big human impact really 
      is on this planet.

    <h3><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a></h3>
    <p>I've used the site for whenever I'm editing an essay. Unlike Word Document it won't pick up on certain grammar, or repetitive 
      words in your essay. I find it really helpful and the best part is that it's free.
