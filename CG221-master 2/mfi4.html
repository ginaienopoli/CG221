    <p>This site tells you fake reviews on Amazon or Yelp and stops you from buying any of those products. Typically these fake
     reviews are formed because of bots, or people getting free or discounted products. So this site is a great way to get products with
     real reviews and actual good products that are worthy of their high ratings.

    <p>I have to cook a lot in my dorm. I don't have a lot of experience with cooking and dont know how many combinations there 
    are with ingredients, but this website helps a lot. You just tell them what's in your fridge, and they will give you results of 
    what you can make with what you have already. Although sometimes they include one missing ingredient, but if it looks really 
    appetitizing then you can go out and buy it if you want! I live about 5 minutes away from the grocery store so it's no big hassle for
    me.
