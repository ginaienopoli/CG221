    <p>You can upload a picture of yourself, or your friends and it can tell how old you look like. Although it is off for me,
        since it said I was 25 or 30, for my other friends it was close. It's a funny site to use, like uploading a funny picture
        and being told you look 50, or just getting an age completely off. It's a fun way to bond with your friends.

    <p>What They See is a tumblr account that posts what the art work in museums see. It ranges from paintings to sculptures.
        Although this isn't a professional website, I really love the idea of it. It shows what you see (the artwork) and then
        what the artwork sees. It's such an unique idea that gives you such a different perspective as if the art is alive.
